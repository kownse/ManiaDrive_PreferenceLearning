Upgrading win32 sdk php.

Using Php pre compiled binaries (it is not possible to build php from source with mingwin).

Creating libphp5ts.a from the dll.

Generate a.def file from the DLL, using "pexports php5ts.dll > a.def"
Generate .lib file from the DLL, using "dlltool -C -d a.def -l libphp5ts.a"
Copy libphp5ts.a in the lib directory of win32 sdk.

Need to update all include 180 files from source distribution of php for windows.

Copy php related dll from php distributed binaries package to raydium bin dir:
libeay32.dll
php5ts.dll
php_curl.dll
php_soap.dll
ssleay32.dll

include file tweaking (for version 5.2.9).
